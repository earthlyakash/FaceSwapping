## Workshop: Precision Image Face Swapping with OpenCV

Welcome to our professional workshop on automating the precise face swapping process using OpenCV. In this workshop, we will demonstrate how to leverage the dlib library for accurate facial landmark detection and create triangulated maps of faces. By ensuring the maintenance of perspective, size, and proportion, we can achieve high precision in our face swapping results. OpenCV will play a crucial role in warping and transferring the triangular components between two images.

The best part is that once we complete this process, we can easily extend our code to work seamlessly with live video streams, eliminating the need for any human intervention. Our program will handle all the necessary tasks autonomously.

### Prerequisites:
Before we begin, please ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Jupyter Notebook: Install Jupyter Notebook, a popular environment for interactive coding and documentation. You can follow the installation instructions provided on the official Jupyter website (https://jupyter.org/install).

3. Required Python packages: Install the following packages using pip, the Python package installer:
   - OpenCV: OpenCV is a powerful computer vision library. Install it by running the command `pip install opencv-python`.
   - dlib: dlib is a robust library for facial landmark detection. Install it by running the command `pip install dlib`.

By ensuring these prerequisites are met, you will have all the necessary tools and libraries at your disposal to fully engage in this professional workshop on precision image face swapping with OpenCV.
